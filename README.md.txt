To reproduced this notebook on a local machine;
1. create a conda environment using the file environment.yml included in this folder

It works better on open stack.
on the exiting hds_forecast conda environment.
2 . The data set was deployed on a github repository and linked to the notebook using a url provided in the notebook.

Thanks.
