# Healthcare Emergency Forecast

While doing this forecasting project, my main goal was to recommend a suitable forecasting method for an NHS acute trust, and provide a twenty eight days forecast of the daily number of paediatric emergency attendance. After a careful evaluation and comparison of the suitable method with a naive benchmark on a twenty-eight days forecast result, using the root mean square error score(RMSE) scores of these methods on test data, I decides which method is the best for the NHS Trust to forecast daily number of pediatric emergency attendances at the hospital. The least RMSE value shows which method would be useful the most for their data to support them with planning their staffing decision to sufficiently handle pediatric emergency attendances. which was “Prophet” as it produced lowest error score.
